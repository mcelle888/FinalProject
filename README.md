## R4. User Stories


User stories capture the purpose of an application by describing the requirements and expectations that users have when using the application. User needs are presented in a simple and informal manner to clearly drive development in the planning phase of a project. In this project, the user stories below assist in defining and prioritizing the key functionalities the target audience (couples and guests) require when managing and responding to wedding invitations. 

**Admin (Couple)**

As an admin I would like to be able to update these details if needed. 

As an admin I would like to be able to view the guest lists RSVP responses 

As an admin I would like to be able to filter and sort the guest list by who is coming, who has declined and who has not responded. 

As an admin I would like to view the status of the menu voting (additional feature)

**Users (Guests):**

As a guest I would like to view details about the wedding (Date, Venue, Time, Menu) 

As a guest I would like to respond to the couples RSVP

As a guest I would like to be able to add additional guests to my RSVP (e.g. children)
